# MancFurs ICS Calendar

## Archived: Official feed exists now: https://www.mancfurs.org.uk/calendar/feed/

This calendar link is updated from the events list taken from the [MancFurs website](https://www.mancfurs.org.uk/attending/?calendar).

You can subscribe to it by adding the [raw ICS link](calendar.ics?raw=1) to your calendar.

It is currently manually updated, however the generation of the file is fairly automated. I use this myself in my own calendar, which means I'll look to keep this up to date with any changes MancFurs makes to the schedule. 

If you need to reach out to me, contact details can be found on [my website](https://marta.nz)
